# MSU AI Course Homeworks

This repository contains my completed homework assignments for the **Artificial Intelligence course** at **Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU)**. The course is designed for young scientists across all faculties and covers modern machine learning and neural network techniques applicable to research and practical problems.

The repository includes notebooks corresponding to **15 course topics**, covering:

- **Introduction to Machine Learning** – linear regression, gradient descent, SVM, classification, regression metrics.  
- **Linear Models** – decision trees, ensemble methods (bagging, boosting, random forests), gradient boosting, stacking.  
- **Classical Machine Learning** – data preprocessing, handling imbalanced datasets, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).  
- **Feature Generation and Selection** – manual and model-based feature selection, Boruta, greedy methods.  
- **Neural Networks** – MLPs, activation functions, backpropagation, PyTorch basics.  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks** – 1D, 2D, 3D convolutions, transfer learning, feature visualization.  
- **Neural Network Optimization** – gradient vanishing/explosion, initialization, normalization, regularization, optimizers, learning rate scheduling.  
- **Neural Network Architectures** – ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, skip connections, grouped convolutions.  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks** – basic RNN, LSTM, seq2seq modeling, NLP preprocessing.  
- **Transformers** – attention mechanism, encoder-decoder architectures, BERT, GPT, ViT.  
- **Segmentation and Object Detection** – semantic segmentation, U-Net, YOLO, Panoptic Segmentation, mAP evaluation.  
- **Representation Learning** – autoencoders, variational autoencoders, Siamese networks, metric learning.  
- **Generative Models** – GANs, DCGAN, conditional GANs, diffusion models, latent space sampling.  
- **Explainability** – model interpretability techniques (LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradients, attention visualization).  
- **Reinforcement Learning** – multi-armed bandits, Markov decision processes, Gymnasium environment, DQN, cross-entropy method.  

Each notebook contains **hands-on exercises** with explanations and implementations in Python (NumPy, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
